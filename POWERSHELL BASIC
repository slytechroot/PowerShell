You don’t have to, but you can do the updates in the Win7 VM (yes, it is a lot of updates).

You’ll need to create directory in the Win7 VM called “c:\ps”

In this file, you will also need to change the text ‘192.168.11.129’ to the IP address of your Ubuntu host.

Powershell Basics

PowerShell is Microsoft’s new scripting language that has been built in since the release Vista.

PowerShell file extension end in .ps1 .

An important note is that you cannot double-click on a PowerShell script to execute it.

To open a PowerShell command prompt either hit Windows Key + R and type in PowerShell or Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Windows PowerShell -> Windows PowerShell.

    cd c:\
    dir
    cd
    ls

 

To obtain a list of cmdlets, use the Get-Command cmdlet

    Get-Command

 

You can use the Get-Alias cmdlet to see a full list of aliased commands.

    Get-Alias

 

Don’t worry you won’t blow up your machine with Powershell

    Get-Process | stop-process              Don't press [ ENTER ] What will this command do?
    Get-Process | stop-process -whatif

 

To get help with a cmdlet, use the Get-Help cmdlet along with the cmdlet you want information about.

    Get-Help Get-Command
    Get-Help Get-Service –online
    Get-Service -Name TermService, Spooler
    Get-Service –N BITS

 

Run cmdlet through a pie and refer to its properties as $_

    Get-Service | where-object {  $_.Status -eq "Running"}

 

PowerShell variables begin with the $ symbol. First let’s create a variable

    $serv = Get-Service –N Spooler

 

To see the value of a variable you can just call it in the terminal.

    $serv
    $serv.gettype().fullname

 

Get-Member is another extremely useful cmdlet that will enumerate the available methods and properties of an object. You can pipe the object to Get-Member or pass it in

    $serv | Get-Member
    Get-Member -InputObject $serv

 

Let’s use a method and a property with our object.

    $serv.Status
    $serv.Stop()
    $serv.Refresh()
    $serv.Status
    $serv.Start()
    $serv.Refresh()
    $serv.Status
